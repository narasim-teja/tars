# TARS - Transformative Action Recognition System

TARS is a decentralized platform that revolutionizes social impact verification through AI-driven analysis and DAO governance. By combining EigenLayer's AVS (Actively Validated Service) with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, we create a trustless pipeline from real-world observation to on-chain action.
